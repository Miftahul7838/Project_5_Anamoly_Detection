# Project_5_Anamoly_Detection
Had extra time from professor, and he said in class to implement only two of the algorithms mentioned in the research paper.

put the codes in a directory called src and put all the labelled data .csv files in a folder called data. src and data forlders have to be on the same directory level.

The only metrics that was used to measture this is AUROC to match the research paper. And the other metrics might have not given a proper metrics for evaluation.
